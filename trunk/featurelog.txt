3.0.1   Almost no functionality, merely draws a circle.   
3.0.2   Still almost no functionality, makes a mass that bounces once, then freezes.
3.0.3   Better, the applet no longer freezes.
3.1.0   MUCH Better! Applet no longer freezes, runs smoothly. Introduced clicking to add masses, dragging to add them at an initial velocity, Differentiating between right and left clicking.
3.1.1   Started to work on shift-clicking and dragging to pick up and move things.
3.1.2   Can shift drag to pick things up. Hold the shift button and left mouse button, and as soon as you're near a mass, you shall pick it up
3.1.3   Made picking things up less fail, changed the source code slightly so it looks better. 
3.1.4	Can now delete - hold CTRL and move the mouse near a mass. Toggle simulate/construct with space. Hit d to switch to fixed mass, f for free mass.
